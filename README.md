# Stephen Prizio's Website

This is the source code to my personal website, built with Bulma and Angular 4.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to recreate and build this project in your own development environments.

### Prerequisites

- Git  
- Node.js
- NPM  
- Angular CLI (no AngularJS)

### Installation

`git clone` https://github.com/sPrizio/MyWebsite.git

Fetch front-end dependencies

`npm install`

Run dev server

`npm start` is preferred but `ng serve` should also work. Once running, open a browser and navigate to `localhost:4200`
